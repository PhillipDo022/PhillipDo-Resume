        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Phillip Do. I am currently a second year Biology major at the University of California, Riverside. I am formerly the Vietnamese Student Academic Chair and presently the Vietnamese Student Association President. I used to work at my family's food truck in Portland, Oregon but am studying for a role as a dental assistant. My hobbies include cooking, mostly Asian dishes, photography, and cars. <br><br>

        Being a biology major is an exciting and intellectually stimulating journey. As a biology major, students dive deep into the intricate world of living organisms, exploring the complexities of life and its processes. However, this path is not without its challenges. One of the tougher aspects of being a biology major is tackling rigorous coursework. Courses such as biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology demand a strong foundation in chemistry and a keen understanding of complex biological systems. These classes often require extensive reading, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. The workload can be daunting, especially when coupled with laboratory sessions and research projects. However, these challenges ultimately contribute to the development of a strong scientific mindset and analytical abilities. For those aspiring to pursue dentistry, being a pre-dental college student adds an extra layer of preparation and commitment. Alongside the biology major requirements, pre-dental students must fulfill specific prerequisites for dental schools, which often include additional coursework in subjects like anatomy, physiology, and microbiology. Maintaining a competitive GPA, participating in extracurricular activities, and gaining hands-on experience through volunteering or shadowing opportunities become crucial for a successful dental school application. Balancing the demands of a rigorous curriculum and the aspirations of becoming a dentist can be overwhelming. Time management and effective study strategies become paramount. Building strong relationships with professors and seeking guidance from academic advisors or mentors can provide invaluable support. Nevertheless, being a biology major and a pre-dental student can also be immensely rewarding. The knowledge gained in these fields lays a strong foundation for a future career in dentistry. The experience of working in laboratories, conducting research, and understanding the intricacies of the human body equips students with a comprehensive understanding of biological processes that are directly applicable to dental practice.<br><br>

        College life is not without its benefits, though. Joining VSA was a major stepping stone into developing socially, personally, and professionally. I first started out when I was a freshman, and got into the intern program. Being an intern let me see how things worked behind the scenes on staff, without committing and taking up real responsibilities. With the personal connections and the family I made that year, I decided to follow in my big’s footsteps and become the Academic Chair. It fit well within my skill set as a very academically driven person. Recently this spring, I was elected VSA President for my vision and plans for the club. Since then I’ve been in charge of many inter- and intra- club relationships and activities.
